Attention!

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL NAPP AND IT'S EVENTS, METHODS AND STRUCTURES MAY CHANGE A LOT ON THE NEXT FEW DAYS/WEEKS, USE IT AT YOUR OWN DISCERNEMENT

The Kronos Napp NApp is responsible for data persistence, saving and retrieving information from time series database (TSDB). It can be acessed by external agents through the REST API or by other NApps, using the event-based methods.

The data can be saved in a different namespace, with support for nested namespaces.

The NApp is designed to support many options of back-end persistence solutions. Currently InfluxDB backend is under development, but alternatives for other TSDB can be implemented in the future.

########
Installing
########

All of the Kytos Network Applications are located in the NApps online repository.
To install this NApp, run:

.. code:: shell

   $ kytos napps install kytos/kronos

########
Configuring
########

If you want to configure your Napp, please take a look on settings.py file. In this file you will see a few options to configure appropriately your Napp. 

This configuring options change according to the backend you are using. Example, if you are using a CSVBackend (which is the most simple backend), it does not have options like PORT, PASS, HOST and DBNAME. However, in a more robust backend, using InfluxDB backend as example, you have this options to set.

########
Events
########

The NApp listens to events requesting operations. Every event must have a callback function to be executed right after the internal method returns. The signature of the callback function is described with each event.
kytos.storehouse.create

kytos.kronos.save
=======================
Event requesting to save data in a namespace from backand.

kytos.kronos.get
=======================
Event requesting data in a namespace from backand.

kytos.kronos.delete
=======================
Event requesting to delete data in a namespace from backand.

########
Rest API
########

You can find a list of the available endpoints and example input/output in the
'REST API' tab in this NApp's webpage in the `Kytos NApps Server
<https://napps.kytos.io/kytos/storehouse>`_.
